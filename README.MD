## react application to mimick AutoList.com
part of coding challenge for frontend position


### what I would have liked to done
- utilizing react router so that a user could copy/paste url to a specific car
- better styling

### what I'm happy with
- When making a request for a collection of vehicles from the endpoint, the response is stored in Redux application state in such a way that the ID of each vehicale is the key of each property
- reduer for fetching cars accepts an object of filter information that will form a URL endpoint that make query parameters for each key/value
